                <p>The hero of our story and the most mysterious member of the Culper Ring. It’s up to you to discover
                    her role in the American War of Independence. </p>
                <p>The true identity of Agent 355 remains unknown, but her code number, 355, could be decrypted from the
                    encryption system that the Culper Ring used, which reveals the word “lady.” This would suggest that
                    she may have had some social standing, and it is, therefore, reasonable to presume that she was a
                    member of the New York City Society. </p>

                <h5><i>Codename: John Bolton</i></h5>
                <p>Tallmadge was appointed as the leader of the Culper Ring – named for the Culpeper County in Virginia
                    – by Washington himself. Prior to his appointment as Washington’s director of military
                    intelligence, Tallmadge had been a major in the Light Dragoons, so well understood the war being
                    fought. Tallmadge played a prominent role in the exposure of Benedict Arnold’s treachery as well as
                    the role of Major John Andre. </p>
                <p>Tallmadge took the safety of his operatives very seriously. He was insistent on their having
                    codenames for their operations, and he also developed a cipher system to protect his messages. These
                    tactics, along with the use of invisible ink and the simple ploy of addressing the dispatches to
                    Tory sympathisers (meaning they were never searched thoroughly), helped ensure that not a single one
                    of Tallmadge’s agents were ever discovered by the British.</p>

                <h5><i>Codename: Samuel Culper Senior</i></h5>
                <p>As one of the leading members of the Culper Ring, indicated by his code name, Woodhull had
                    initially been a farmer and was rather reluctant to join the Revolutionary’s cause. However,
                    Tallmadge was, in fact, Woodhull’s neighbor in Setauket, and it is this connection that led to his
                    role in the spy ring.</p>

                <p>Woodhull’s role involved the gathering of intelligence from inside New York City itself, under the
                    pretense of visiting his sister Mary Underhill. Woodhull would pass this information to Caleb
                    Brewster, who would deliver it to Tallmadge, who would, in turn, pass it onto Washington himself.
                    Woodhull stopped going to New York City itself and instead became another link in the chain of
                    communication.</p>

                <img src="images/Washington.jpg" />
                <p>The leader of the American Revolution and the director of the Culper Ring’s operations. Washington
                    established the spy ring in 1778 at the time of the British occupation of New York. The Commander of
                    the Revolutionary Army used the group to provide him with details of British activities in New York
                    City, their base of operations. The most notable news provided by the Ring to Washington was of the
                    surprise attack on the by British on the allied French forces of Lieutenant General Rochambeau on
                    Rhode Island. The Culper Ring was also responsible for the revelation about the British attempts to
                    counterfeit American currency. They also uncovered the treachery of Benedict Arnold.</p>

                <h5><i>Codename: Samuel Culper Junior & 723</i></h5>
                <p>Under his various aliases, Robert Townsend is one of the least well-known members of the
                    Culper Ring. Such was his commitment to secrecy that he once allegedly demanded of Woodhull
                    that he never reveal his real name – not even to Washington himself!</p>
                <p>Like Culper Senior, Culper Junior’s role was to remain in New York City to collect information on
                    British movements and plans. One of Townsend’s most notable discoveries was of the British
                    plot to ruin the fledgling American economy by flooding the country with vast quantities of
                    counterfeit dollars.</p>

                <h2><img src="./titles/Asset 35.svg" /></h2>
                <p>Brewster’s main role in the Culper Ring was as a courier. He is the man who helped carry the all-important messages between Woodhull and Tallmadge. As well as delivering messages, Brewster was also
                    an adept smuggler and espionage agent, utilizing the skills he had developed as an officer in the
                    Continental Army.</p>
                <p>After the war, Brewster continued to make use of the skills he developed in the Culper Ring. He
                    joined the United States Revenue Cutter Service, the precursor to the US Coast Guard. </p>

                <h2><img src="./titles/Asset 36.svg" /></h2>
                <p>Strong’s role in the Culper Ring was to relay signals to Caleb Brewster on his smuggling and courier
                    missions. She did this by hanging a black petticoat on a clothesline at her house in Strong Point,
                    Setauket. Then, she would add a number of white handkerchiefs – between one and six – depending on
                    which cove Brewster would sail his ship into. </p>

                <p>
                    The Culper Ring was responsible for providing the intelligence to the American’s French allies
                    that disrupted the British Navy’s attempt to rescue General Cornwallis from his beleaguered
                    position at Yorktown.

                <p>
                    One of the most important achievements of the Culper Ring was to expose the British plan to
                    wreck the American economy through the use of an enormous number of counterfeit dollar
                    bills.</p>
