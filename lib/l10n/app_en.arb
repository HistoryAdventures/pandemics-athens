He would do as Calyx asked.“Would you like to say goodbye to your wife?” Nikos whispered.“No, do it before she returns,” Calyx confirmed. Nikos couldn’t look at what he was doing as he held the flailing man under the bath water. Moments after the aristocrat's movement stopped, Eleni walked in to see her husband dead in the bath.“He succumbed to his condition. There was nothing I could do.” Nikos hoped the widow believed him. Eleni just nodded and Nikos left the woman to mourn her husband.",
